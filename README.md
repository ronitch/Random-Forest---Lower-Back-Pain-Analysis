# Random-Forest---Lower-Back-Pain-Analysis

While lower back pain is extremely common, the symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary greatly. A simple lower back muscle strain might be excruciating enough to necessitate an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild, intermittent discomfort.

A Random Forest Analysis has been performed based on 12 Attributes of the lower back's physical composition to predict whether the Spinal Cord's condition is "Normal" or "Abnormal". 
The model's accuracy was increased from 72.58% to 80.64% through Hyperparameters Tuning.
